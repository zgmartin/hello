##About me:

Welcome to personal github account.

I am a programmer/mathematician who enjoys writing well designed clean code. My coding phylosophy is simmilar to the phylosophy of the arch linux community (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way). Always striving to write high quality code is my personal goal. Designing clean code is what makes coding enjoyable and fun for everyone within the coding community. I hope to accomplish this goal through the code I submit to this account. 

In addition to coding, I also value the ideals of social coding and collaboration. I have benefited immensely from the the code of others, and I would like to demonstrate the same kindness through the sharing of my own work. 

Thanks again for visiting me here.
