##About me:
<img src = "./me.png">

9:22, Personal note: When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so once when I was six, I did. At first the brightness was overwhelming, but I had seen that before. I kept looking, forcing myself not to blink, and then the brightness began to dissolve. My pupils shrunk to pinholes and everything came into focus and for a moment I understood.

Welcome to personal github account.

I am a programmer/mathematician who enjoys writing clean code.
My coding philosophy is similar to the philosophy of the arch Linux community (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way). 
Always striving to write high quality code is my personal goal. Clean code is what makes coding enjoyable and fun for everyone within the coding community. I hope to accomplish this goal through the code I submit to this account. 

In addition to coding, I also value the ideals of social coding and collaboration. I have benefited immensely from the the code of others, and I would like to demonstrate the same kindness through the sharing of my own work.
