Ok, so down the rabbit hole we go.

Iâ€™m a big fan of the canonical example concept. All big ideas can be understood and reduced to simple easy to construct examples. For example, if you want to understand most of the ideas within Proofs just take the simple example of proving x is an irrational number: for x^2=2, and after going through the construction of your argument you find yourself becoming aware of the axiomatic system, logical inference, and the big idea of proof by contradiction, which basically spans the space of the mathematicians tool set to solve problems. So in any other area you encounter within life, reduce the problem to the simplest instance, picture the problem in your head, and use it as a reference point when challenged with similar problems in the future. Below are my personal recommendations on becoming a better problem solver and some programming tips I found out about along the way.


##Math:
###Proof Logic and Conjecture: A Mathematician's Toolbox
There is one math book to rule them all (Lord of the Rings style). If you read this book forwards and backwards you will become a math master armed with powerful mathematical conceptual thinking which is spread throughout all scientific disciplines. After spending time with this book, you can walk into any technical conversation with the confidence to analyze and solve problems through the fundamental framework of mathematical thinking (that's serious power). The book covers all the big areas within mathematics (Proofs, Linear Algebra, Algebra, Analysis(a.k.a. Calculus), Number Theory). This book breaks all these ideas down into nice simple reading material, which will vastly improve your problem solving skills.


##Programming:
###The Algorithm Design Manual
A true gem within space of learning. This is the Algorithms Book that every computer scientist or problem solver must read. My teacher, Steve Skiena at Stony Brook, wrote this majestically elegant book. With the basics under you belt, you can solve  any computational problem after reading this. This book essentially teaches you techniques on how to become a better problem solver in the world of computing. The big topics covered are Algorithmic Thinking, Graphs, Combinatorial Problems, and Problem References. Seriously, read this forwards and backwards. If you don't believe me, then believe Google. This is the book they recommend people read before they try to work there. I can't stress to you how much this book has influenced me. It completely changed my approach to solving programming problems. A company even flew me out to their office in Palo Alto California after I solved a problem for them by referencing this book (specifically chapter 10).

###Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
I have not seen a better data structure book on the subject yet. Lots of illustrations and clean layout with all the necessary concepts (Sorting, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Recursion). But do not use Java, try out the examples in python instead. Python is a much better language for messing around and experimenting with ideas.


##Language:
Use python for all your programming. Why? It's blindingly fast to develop in. Its about to blow past old languages like C and Java because of its developmental speed. More people are using for their projects, so it will soon become a standard. It also integrates well with old C code where constant speed performance is critical. Go through the entire set of tutorials. Also use ipython command to mess around and test ideas in the linux command prompt. Use the sublime text editor to develop and write your code.

###Python for Data Analysis:
Read the introduction and the section on how to work with and install ipython.


###Learning Python Lutz:
Do not read the entire book. It is too long. Just use it as a reference to understanding more details about python.


##Linux:
Every company is running some type of linux machine so dive in, get rid of the GUI interface, and fire up the command line.

###The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction
This book is great for learning about the details of the linux system.


##Databases:
Learn both Mongo and SQL databases. Companies want to see the old school SQL knowledge and the new school No SQL database. Heres a good read on what those two ideas main (http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained).

##Web:
All your web needs are here.

##Additional Books:
Only look at these after you have done the things above. The above material is more important.


###Understanding Analysis:
Teaches you all of calculus the way calculus should be taught.


###Linear Algebra: and its applications David C. Lay;
Lots of Linear algebra computation and ideas used in computer science algorithms.


###A Course in Probability Weiss:
The best book on probability.


###How to Solve It Polya:
All the great problem solvers that I heard of or met have read this book.


###Journey through Genius:
The history of math and how they solved problems. Inspirational stories.


###Calculated Bets: Computers Gambling, and Mathematical Modeling To Win:
How to use computers to model the world and win money.


###The C Programming Language:
Teaches you the ins and outs of C by the people who wrote it.


###The Nature of Code:
A great book with a lot of powerful ideas about modeling physical systems (Particle System, Autonomous Agents, Evolution, Neural Nets).


###Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Bishop:
Find the patterns within the world (driving cars, flying planes, image detection, trading systems). The applications are endless with vast amounts of data at hand.
